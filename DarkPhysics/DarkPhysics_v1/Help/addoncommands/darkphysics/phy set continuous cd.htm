 Continuous collision detection is useful for fast moving objects. With traditional collision detection fast moving objects can pass through other objectsduring a single time step. This effect is known as tunneling. Imagine a bullet traveling towards a thin metal plate, in the first time step it would be on one side and in the next it would be on the other. The physics engine would never detect a collision and hence not constrain the motion of the bullet. <br><br>To deal with this problem a technique known as continuous collision detection ( CCD ) is necessary, instead of testing for collisionat discrete points it tests an extruded volume which represents the objects motion during the whole time step. If a collision is detected, the time of impact can be computed and the objects motion constrained appropriately. Currently CCD is only supported between dynamic mesh objects and the static environment. <br><br>Because CCD is slow in comparison to discrete collision detection methods, there are a couple of optimizations. Firstly CCD is only applied to fast moving objects, if an object is simply resting on a surface, then discrete collision detection is sufficient. Secondly CCD is performed with a skeleton ( mesh ) embedded within the object, this can be simpler than the geometry used for discrete collision detection. Hence the skeleton stops the object flying through other objects and a higher frequency discrete collision object can provide morerealistic behavior when the object is resting or rolling on another. A CCD Skeleton is a kind of mesh. It has a special name because its stored in a special format, and there are less restrictions on it than on other kinds of meshes. In addition a single CCD skeleton can be associated with multiple shapes to reduce the memory overhead. Use a value of 1.0 to enable CCD and a value of 0.0 to disable CCD.
